Game Description: 2048 in C (Console Version)

Dive into the classic and addictive 2048 puzzle game, now playable from the console in C! Test your logic and planning skills as you merge numbers to achieve the ultimate goal.

Objective
Combine tiles with the same numbers to create the 2048 tile and set new high scores!

How to Play
The game board is a 4x4 grid, starting with two tiles (2 or 4) placed randomly.
Use the following keys to move the tiles:
R: Slide tiles right

D: Slide tiles down
U: Slide tiles up
When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with their sum (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty space on the grid.

The game ends when the board is full, and no valid moves remain.
